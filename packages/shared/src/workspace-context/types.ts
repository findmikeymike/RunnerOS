/**
 * Workspace Context — types
 *
 * A "Context Doc" is a markdown file holding workspace-level guidance:
 * goals, vision, voice/style, glossary, anything the user wants their
 * agents to read before starting work.
 *
 * Design choices that drive the schema:
 *   - One file per topic (not one big workspace.md). Lets users keep
 *     "voice & style" separate from "Q2 product goals" and route them
 *     to different agents.
 *   - Routing is per-doc. Default = broadcast to every agent. Targeted
 *     routing names specific agent slugs.
 *   - Delivery and access are separate. `always` docs may enter a prompt;
 *     `on-demand` docs remain available for explicit retrieval only.
 *   - The Concierge may retrieve every enabled non-private doc regardless
 *     of routing. Private docs still obey their declared routing.
 *   - Frontmatter mirrors AGENT.md / SKILL.md so the YAML+markdown idiom
 *     stays consistent.
