/**
 * Agent Definitions — types
 *
 * An "Agent" is a saved, reusable bundle of session configuration:
 *   LLM connection + model + system prompt + skills + sources + runtime knobs.
 *
 * Agents live in a single GLOBAL library (`~/.agents/agents/`) and are
 * activated per-workspace via an activation manifest. Compare with skills
 * which today live per-workspace by default — agents intentionally invert
 * that to reduce friction ("a great agent is reusable everywhere").
 *
 * NOT to be confused with the runtime "Agent" classes in `../agent/`
 * (claude-agent.ts, base-agent.ts). Those are the executor; this is the
 * persisted persona that an executor runs as.
