# Workflow file format — `WORKFLOW.md`

A workflow is one file. Same YAML+markdown idiom as `AGENT.md`, `SKILL.md`, `CONTEXT.md`. The frontmatter declares the pipeline; the body is free-form notes (purpose, intended use, gotchas — like a top-of-file comment).

## Storage location

```
~/.workflows/<slug>/WORKFLOW.md
```

Global library, like agents — workflows are reusable across workspaces. A per-workspace activation manifest decides which subset is visible (mirror the agent activation pattern from `packages/shared/src/agent-definitions/storage.ts`).

Slug rules: same as agents — lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; 1–64 chars; no leading/trailing hyphen. Reuse `AGENT_SLUG_REGEX`.

## Frontmatter schema (current)

```yaml
---
name: Weekly Content Pipeline
description: Research a topic, draft a post, critique it, hand off for publish.
avatar: 📝               # optional — emoji shown in lists/picker
trigger:
  type: manual           # only manual is supported today
  inputs:                # optional — input form schema for manual runs
    - name: topic
      type: string
      required: true
      description: What to write about
    - name: word_count
      type: number
      default: 600
steps:
  - id: research          # required, unique within workflow, slug-shaped
    agent: researcher     # agent slug
    input: |
      Research {{trigger.topic}}. Cite primary sources.
    timeout: 300          # optional, seconds
    retries: 1            # optional, non-negative integer
    completion:           # optional completion gate
      requireToolUse: true
      minOutputChars: 200
      maxAgentMessages: 2 # hard cap across this step's retries
  - id: draft
    agent: writer
    input: |
      Write a {{trigger.word_count}}-word post from this research:

      {{steps.research.output}}
  - id: critique
    agent: critic
    input: "{{steps.draft.output}}"
  - id: revise
    agent: writer
    input: |
      Revise the draft using this critique. Keep the same word count.

      Draft: {{steps.draft.output}}
      Critique: {{steps.critique.output}}

# Weekly Content Pipeline

Notes for humans go in the body — when to run this, what good output looks like, etc. The runner ignores the body entirely.
```

## Field reference

### Top level

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable display name. |
| `description` | string | yes | One-sentence summary; shown in pickers. |
| `avatar` | string | no | Single emoji for UI. |
| `trigger` | object | no | Defaults to `{ type: 'manual' }`. |
| `steps` | array | yes | 1+ steps. See below. |

### Step object

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique slug within the workflow. Used in templating. |
| `agent` | string | yes | Agent slug. Slug shape is checked at parse time; existence is checked when the step runs. |
| `input` | string | yes | The user-message for that step's session. Supports `{{...}}` templating. |
| `description` | string | no | Human-readable note for the step. UI hint only. |
| `outputSchema` | JSON Schema | no | If set, the step's session is asked to emit JSON matching this schema. The schema must be an object with a top-level `type`. |
| `timeout` | number (seconds) | no | Step session is aborted and the attempt fails if it exceeds this positive duration. |
| `retries` | number | no | Non-negative integer. How many times to retry after a failed attempt. Default 0. |
| `onFailure` | `stop` \| `continue` \| `ask` | no | What happens after exhausted retries. `stop` fails the run, `continue` records the failed step and runs later steps, `ask` currently stops until human checkpoint support lands. |
| `completion` | object | no | Completion contract enforced after the agent turn. See below. |

### Completion contract

`completion` prevents workflow steps from succeeding after a mere acknowledgement.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `requireNonEmptyOutput` | boolean | no | Defaults to `true`. Set `false` only for unusual steps where empty output is acceptable. |
| `minOutputChars` | number | no | Non-negative integer. Final assistant output must be at least this many characters. |
| `requireToolUse` | boolean | no | If true, the step session must record at least one successful tool result before completion. |
| `maxAgentMessages` | number | no | Integer from 0 to 20. Hard cap on `message_agent` delegations for this step across all retry attempts. |

Unsupported step fields today: `when`, `humanCheckpoint`, and `parallelGroup`.

### Trigger types

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `manual` | User clicks Run, fills in the optional `trigger.inputs` form. |

Unsupported trigger types today: `schedule`, `automation`, and `webhook`.

## Templating

Mustache-ish, intentionally tiny. **Do not pull in a templating library** — write a 50-line resolver.

| Token | Resolves to |
|-------|-------------|
| `{{trigger.<field>}}` | Value from the trigger inputs. |
| `{{steps.<id>.output}}` | The whole output of step `<id>` (string when no `outputSchema`, JSON otherwise). |
| `{{steps.<id>.output.<path>}}` | Dot-path into structured output (only valid when step had `outputSchema`). |
| `{{run.id}}` | Current run ID (UUID). |
| `{{run.startedAt}}` | ISO timestamp. |

Templating rules:
- Resolution happens **just before** a step executes, not at parse time. (You may want one step's output to influence whether the next runs.)
- A reference to a step that hasn't run yet → validation error at parse time.
- Unknown references resolve to an empty string at runtime and emit a warning, but the parser rejects references it can prove are invalid.
- No expressions, no filters, no conditionals, and no loops. If you reach for that complexity, reconsider whether this should be a workflow or a Room.

## Validation (parse time)

A `WORKFLOW.md` is invalid (and the runner refuses to start) if any of:
- `name`, `description`, or `steps` are missing or empty
- a step `id` is duplicated, missing, or non-slug-shaped
- a step `agent` is missing or not slug-shaped
- a templating reference points to a non-existent step or future step
- a templating reference points to an undeclared trigger input
- `outputSchema` is present but is not a JSON Schema object with a top-level `type`
- `timeout` is present but is not a positive number
- `retries` is present but is not a non-negative integer
- `onFailure` is present but is not `stop`, `continue`, or `ask`
- `completion` is present but is not an object, or its fields have invalid types

Validation runs at write time (in the editor) and again at the start of every run. UI surfaces the error inline; the runner refuses to start with a clear message.

## What goes in the body?

Free-form markdown. Suggested sections:

- **When to run this** — manual cadence, triggering condition.
- **Inputs cheatsheet** — what the user should put in each input.
- **Known limitations** — flaky steps, expected failure modes.
- **Changelog** — small log of edits. Optional; git is the canonical history.

The runner does not read the body. It exists for humans browsing the file, and for the future "fork this workflow" gesture.

## Round-trip guarantee

Like AGENT.md and CONTEXT.md, the file is the source of truth. The editor reads → mutates → writes the same shape. No hidden DB row. `git diff` is meaningful.
