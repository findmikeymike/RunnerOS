# Workflows — Spec & Plan

A predefined, savable, shareable pipeline of agents that work in sequence (and eventually in parallel) to accomplish a multi-step job.

## Why this exists

RunnerOS has two complementary execution modes:

1. **Fluid orchestration (Rooms)** — multiple agents in a shared session, dispatched dynamically by the Orchestrator or by user @-mentions. Open-ended; great when the path isn't known.
2. **Predefined workflows** (this doc) — a fixed pipeline you save once and run repeatedly. Great when the path *is* known: weekly report, email triage, content production, bug-investigation pipeline.

Workflows give users repeatability + reliability + shareability. Rooms give users flexibility. Both share the same agent runtime — a workflow step is just a session with a pre-filled prompt and a "resume parent run when done" callback.

## Why we are NOT using a framework

Considered: Temporal, DBOS, LangChain/LangGraph, Inngest, ChatDev.

- **Temporal / DBOS** — durable-execution infra for distributed systems. Overkill for a personal agent OS, fights the AGENT.md aesthetic, hides state behind a DB.
- **LangChain / LangGraph** — imposes its own agent abstraction; we already have one (AGENT.md + capability tags). Adopting LangGraph means rebuilding everything we've shipped.
- **Composio** — tool/integration layer, not orchestration.
- **ChatDev** — research project, not infrastructure.

A WorkflowRunner is ~300–500 LOC of plain TypeScript on top of our existing session runtime. We can graduate to Inngest or Trigger.dev later if we ever need durability across restarts or multi-day runs without changing the file format.

## How these docs are organized

| Doc | What you get |
|-----|--------------|
| [`01-spec.md`](./01-spec.md) | The `WORKFLOW.md` file format — frontmatter schema, step shape, templating syntax, validation rules. |
| [`02-runtime.md`](./02-runtime.md) | Runner architecture: how steps execute, output extraction, checkpointing, resume, storage layout. |
| [`03-ux.md`](./03-ux.md) | UI spec: list page, editor, **Run page** (the killer view — vertical pipeline of cards with side-pane drill-down). |
| [`04-implementation-plan.md`](./04-implementation-plan.md) | Phased build plan. Phase 1 is shippable in ~1 week. Each phase has scope + success criteria. |
| [`05-examples.md`](./05-examples.md) | Concrete sample `WORKFLOW.md` files showing realistic uses. |
| [`06-recovery-plan.md`](./06-recovery-plan.md) | Recovery contract for interrupted runs and rerun-from-step. |
| [`07-active-work-dashboard-and-launcher-spec.md`](./07-active-work-dashboard-and-launcher-spec.md) | Current Artist OS plan for the unified Work tabs, Active dashboard, and guided/manual workflow launcher. |

## Status

Core workflow storage, parsing, starter seeding, manual runs, sequential runner
execution, structured step output, timeouts, retries, failure policies, and
completion contracts are implemented. Workflow step sessions are hidden from
the main session list by default and are opened from the Run page inspector
when needed. The implementation plan remains useful for follow-up work, but
the current runtime surface is defined by [`01-spec.md`](./01-spec.md) and
[`02-runtime.md`](./02-runtime.md).

For Artist OS navigation and launch UX, the current authority is
[`07-active-work-dashboard-and-launcher-spec.md`](./07-active-work-dashboard-and-launcher-spec.md).
It supersedes the older standalone Workflows/Automations navigation and raw
input-modal portions of [`03-ux.md`](./03-ux.md) without changing runtime or
storage contracts.

## Hard non-goals (current runtime)

- Visual node-graph editor (later — YAML editing covers MVP).
- Cross-machine durable execution (no need; RunnerOS is local-first).
- Branching / conditionals (`when:` is not supported yet).
- Sub-workflows / nesting (compose by reference later).
- Workflow versioning / migrations (file is the source of truth — git it).

## North star demo

> Kick off a 4-step manual "weekly content" workflow. Walk away. Come back to
> a Run page where completed steps are green and the active step links to its
> underlying session transcript.

Scheduled triggers, human checkpoints, and parallel execution are later work.
