# Team Mode Owner, Editor, and Runner Permissions Spec

Status: implemented in the Team Mode worktree as shared-folder guardrails, not cryptographic or server-backed auth.

## Goal

Keep Team Mode simple: one Owner controls the workspace and connected accounts, Editors can collaborate inside the shared workspace, and one selected runner executes background work after an acknowledged, epoch-fenced handoff.

This is not enterprise RBAC. It is the minimum permission model needed so a small creative team can safely use one shared hub.

## Product Model

### Owner

The Owner is the person who created or claimed the team workspace.

Owner can:

- change Team Mode settings
- grant or revoke collaborator access through the shared-folder provider
- choose the Automation Runner machine
- connect, rotate, or remove API keys and accounts
- approve sensitive sends or posts
- migrate storage
- disable Team Mode

Owner-only actions:

- runner assignment
- team storage changes
- secrets and connected account management
- shared-folder access management outside the app
- bulk email send approval
- destructive workspace actions

### Editor

Editors are collaborators who can work in the shared workspace.

Editor can:

- open the shared workspace
- chat with agents
- create and edit files
- create and edit records, briefs, docs, campaigns, and assets
- manually run safe local actions
- draft community/email/posting jobs for Owner approval

Editor cannot:

- change runner machine
- edit connected accounts or secrets
- change Team Mode storage/settings
- manage shared-folder access
- run background automations
- send bulk/community emails without Owner approval

### Automation Runner

Automation Runner is a machine assignment, not a person role.

The selected runner machine:

- owns background execution
- runs scheduler ticks
- handles local background automation execution
- handles polling/file-watch/message triggers
- uses the Owner's local connected accounts and secrets
- records runner heartbeat, monotonic epoch, and pulse state
- executes external effects only when the destination enforces a stable idempotency key

Non-runner machines:

- can still open the workspace
- can still edit shared files and records according to role
- must skip background automations
- must never silently execute jobs that require connected accounts

Shared-folder metadata cannot prove exclusivity during a sync partition. Runner changes therefore require old-runner acknowledgement; arbitrary outbound webhooks and browser posting stay manual in Team Mode unless an idempotent adapter or online claim authority is present.

## Why This Model

This matches the real small-team use case:

- one person usually owns the accounts and keys
- other people need to create, edit, and chat
- scheduled/integration work must happen from one trusted machine
- full roles/permissions would be slower and heavier than needed

## Data Model

Add a team membership record under shared team metadata. This drives in-app role checks and UI state. Because the metadata lives in the shared folder, it is a collaboration guardrail, not a hard security boundary against a teammate who can edit workspace files outside the app.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "members": [
    {
      "memberId": "member_owner",
      "displayName": "Owner",
      "role": "owner",
      "createdAt": "2026-07-02T00:00:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      "memberId": "member_editor",
      "displayName": "Editor",
      "role": "editor",
      "createdAt": "2026-07-02T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Private machine identity should map to a member:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "workspaceId": "ws_123",
  "memberId": "member_owner",
  "machineId": "machine_abc",
  "displayName": "Michael's MacBook"
}
```

The existing `team.runnerMachineId` remains the runner source of truth.
`team.runnerEpoch` increments on every runner change. Work captures the epoch and rechecks it immediately before execution.

Shared-folder access is the current invite/remove mechanism. If someone can open the shared folder, they can join the workspace as an Editor from the app. True app-level invites, removals, and tamper-proof membership require a future signed metadata or server-backed auth layer.

## Permission Checks

Every sensitive action should call one shared guard:

```ts
assertTeamPermission(workspaceRootPath, {
  action: 'team.runner.assign',
  machineId,
});
```

Initial actions:

- `team.settings.update`: owner
- `team.runner.assign`: owner
- `team.members.invite`: owner, reserved for future app-level invite flow
- `team.members.remove`: owner, reserved for future app-level removal flow
- `secrets.update`: owner
- `storage.migrate`: owner
- `records.write`: owner, editor
- `files.write`: owner, editor
- `agent.chat`: owner, editor
- `automation.background.run`: selected runner machine only
- `community.email.draft`: owner, editor
- `community.email.send`: owner approval plus runner machine execution

## UI

Team Settings should show:

- current user role: Owner or Editor
- current machine: Runner or Non-runner
- runner machine name and heartbeat
- Owner controls for runner assignment
- Current limitation: shared-folder provider controls invite/remove outside the app
- Editor read-only view of team settings

For Editors:

- disable restricted buttons
- show short reason text, such as `Only the Owner can change runner`
- keep creation/editing flows available

## Approval Flow

For sensitive jobs like bulk email:

1. Editor drafts the job.
2. Broadcast job status becomes `needs-owner-approval`.
3. Owner reviews and approves.
4. Runner machine executes the send.
5. Job records who drafted, approved, and executed it.

## Security Rules

- Secrets stay local to the Owner/runner machine.
- Shared folder must not contain raw tokens, OAuth refresh tokens, or credential caches.
- Editors should not receive secrets through shared records, logs, context docs, or generated summaries.
- Runner execution must fail closed if the current machine is not selected runner.
- External execution must fail closed when the target cannot enforce deduplication.
- Owner-only actions must fail closed if member identity is missing or unknown.
- Role checks are in-app enforcement only. They do not protect against direct edits to shared workspace files by someone with folder write access.

## Phase Plan

### Phase A: Permission Substrate

- Done: team members metadata.
- Done: private machine-to-member identity.
- Done: `assertTeamPermission`.
- Done: tests for owner/editor decisions.

### Phase B: Settings Enforcement

- Done: runner assignment, storage migration, Team Mode settings, workspace setting updates, and credential mutations are Owner-gated with workspace context.
- Done: Team Settings shows role and disables runner controls for Editors.
- Future: app-level invite/remove and tamper-resistant membership.

### Phase C: Editor Collaboration

- Done: Editors can write shared records and draft community jobs.
- Done: regression tests confirm Editors cannot change runner.

### Phase D: Owner Approval Jobs

- Done: Editor-created broadcast jobs default to `needs-owner-approval`.
- Remaining future send transport layer must enforce approval at execution time when real sending is added.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Done: Owner can assign runner.
- Done: Editor cannot assign runner.
- Done: Editor can create/edit normal shared records and draft community work.
- Done: non-runner machines skip background automations.
- Done: runner machine remains the only local background execution path after acknowledged handoff and epoch checks.
- Done: non-idempotent browser publishing and outbound webhooks are blocked in shared-folder mode.
- Done: secrets and credential caches are kept out of the shared folder by migration guards.
- Done: Editor-created bulk/community email jobs require Owner approval status.
- Done: UI clearly shows role and runner state.
