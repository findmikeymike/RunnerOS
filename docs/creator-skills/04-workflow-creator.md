# `workflow-creator` skill

Lets a conversational agent draft a new reusable `WORKFLOW.md` through a short dialogue.

## What the user experience looks like

```
User: I want a workflow that takes a bug report, has @triager classify it,
      then @coder propose a fix and @critic review the plan.

Concierge: I can draft a manual workflow for that. What fields do you want to
            enter when you click Run: just the bug report, or repo context too?

User: Bug report and affected package.

Concierge: Here's the WORKFLOW.md draft:
            ...
            Use this as the workflow source?

User: Yes.

Concierge: I can save this as `bug-fix-plan`. Confirm create?

User: Yes.

Concierge: Created workflow `bug-fix-plan`. It is now in the global workflow
            library and active in this workspace.
```

## Save behavior

The skill drafts valid `WORKFLOW.md` source first, asks for explicit
confirmation, then saves through the `create_workflow` session tool. The save
path writes the workflow to the global library and activates it in the current
workspace unless activation fails and is reported separately.

It can use `list_agents` to verify agent slugs, `list_workflows` / `get_workflow`
to avoid duplicating an existing workflow, and `create_workflow` to save the
confirmed source.

## Skill frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: Workflow Creator
description: Interviews the user briefly, then drafts a valid WORKFLOW.md for a reusable manual workflow.
tools:
  - list_agents
  - list_workflows
  - get_workflow
  - create_workflow
inputs: A description of a repeatable multi-step agent workflow.
outputs: A confirmed workflow saved to the library, or a complete WORKFLOW.md draft when the user declines saving.
tags: [creator, meta, workflows]

```

## Supported `WORKFLOW.md` surface

Match the parser and runner in `packages/shared/src/workflows/` and
`packages/server-core/src/workflows/runner.ts`.

- Top-level fields: `name`, `description`, optional `avatar`, `trigger`, `steps`.
- Trigger: only `type: manual`.
- Trigger inputs: `name`, `type` (`string`, `number`, `boolean`), optional
  `required`, `default`, `description`.
- Step fields: `id`, `agent`, `input`, optional `description`, `outputSchema`,
  `timeout`, `retries`, `onFailure`, `completion`.
- `outputSchema` must be a JSON Schema object with at least a top-level `type`.
- `timeout` is positive seconds.
- `retries` is a non-negative integer.
- `onFailure` parses as `stop`, `continue`, or `ask`. `stop` fails the run,
  `continue` records the failed step and proceeds, and `ask` stops until human
  checkpoint support lands.
- `completion` may include `requireNonEmptyOutput`, `minOutputChars`, and
  `requireToolUse`. Use it when the step should not succeed after a mere
  acknowledgement.

Unsupported inside `WORKFLOW.md` today: native schedule/webhook triggers, `when`,
`humanCheckpoint`, `parallelGroup`, loops, branches, and sub-workflows. To run a
workflow from a schedule, webhook, file watch, poll, or message, create a
separate automation with a `{ type: 'workflow', workflowSlug, triggerInputs? }`
action.

## Interview script

Ask only the missing pieces:

1. **Outcome** — what final artifact should the workflow produce?
2. **Run inputs** — what fields should the user fill in on the Run page?
3. **Steps** — which agents run, in what order, and what each receives?
4. **Reliability** — does any step need tool use, a minimum-length answer,
   structured JSON output, timeout, or retry?

If the user already supplied enough detail, draft immediately.

## Validity checklist

- Use a kebab-case workflow slug and kebab-case step IDs.
- Use trigger input names like `topic`, `bug_report`, or `include_tests`; no
  hyphens and no leading digits.
- Every template reference must point to a declared trigger input, an earlier
  step, or `run.id` / `run.startedAt`.
- Use `{{trigger.<name>}}` for run inputs.
- Use `{{steps.<id>.output}}` for an earlier step's whole output.
- Use `{{steps.<id>.output.<field>}}` only when that earlier step has an
  `outputSchema`.
- Do not use expressions, filters, conditionals, loops, or future-step references.

## Draft and save

Always show a complete `WORKFLOW.md` source draft and ask for explicit
confirmation before invoking `create_workflow`. After confirmation, provide the
chosen slug and the create result. If the tool reports activation failure,
clearly say the workflow was saved but is not active in the current workspace.
